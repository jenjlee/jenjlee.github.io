                    <p>Financial responsibility is the process of managing a valuable asset in a way that is considered productive. However, the process of becoming financially responsible begins with understanding the difference between what you want and what you need.</p>
                    
                    <p>College students are influenced by notifications and reminders. We can see this behavior not only in the household in their interactions with family, but also in how they interact with their mobile push notifications.</p>
                      
                    <p>During an interview I had with a student, she expressed that:</p>
                      
                    <p>“Push notifications definitely grab my attention because they surface important information right away.”</p>  
                      
                    <p>In addition, students are motivated by progress. Regularly showing such progress in a way that is visual and engaging is a good way to encourage responsible behaviors. </p>

                    <p>Hatch is a budgeting app that prompts users to set limits and track their spendings through an interactive visualization of a chick on a boat. </p><br>
                    
                    <h5>Why a “Chick on a Boat”?</h5>   
                      
                    <p>Initially, I explored a couple other metaphors:</p>
                      
                    <p>During an interview I had with a student, she expressed that:</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li>Growth of a plant/tree (plant withers when user overspends)</li>
                        <li>Polar bear on an iceberg (iceberg melts as the user goes over the limit)</li>
                        <li>Sandcastle on the beach (water begins to wash out the sandcastle when nearing the user’s limit)</li>
                    </ul>
                      
                    <p>But I decided to use the metaphor of the chick on a boat because it best utilized elements such as water level to represent spending against a budget and also a simple illustration of a chick to reinforce the message of how well you’re staying within a budget. This allowed me to stay away from any metaphors that seemed too serious.</p>  
                      
                    <p>Through the visualization, the user is more compelled to check in on their budget and spending for the month. As a result, the user is able to stay more conscious about their spending behavior and stay within their budgets. </p>

                    <p>I began this project when brainstorming ideas of a product that can ease my daily routine — one thing that came to mind was budgeting. It’s something I don’t do enough due to the consistent need to check and organize lots of numbers and information. However, I realized a simple, but effective visualization of my spendings can be a solution to my lazy shortcomings.</p>
                    
                    <p>I really enjoyed seeing my screens and illustrations develop throughout each process of this project. I was able to keep different edge cases in mind and get critiques from people around me to iterate my designs over and over again. But through this, I also developed the confidence to back up certain design decisions and the process I took to design my final screens.</p>
                      
                    <p>If I had more time to work on this project, I would focus on doing more research and user testing with college students. This would have helped me better understand my problem space to give me more confidence regarding the approach and the design decisions I’ve made.</p>
                      
                    <p>I also wish I had a chance to do some user testing because this would have given me feedback on what’s working well and not working well in my designs. I believe that user testing would have helped me to simply validate or pressure test some of the more minor details of the interaction or visual design elements to my design experience. This feedback would definitely benefit my future iterations.</p>
